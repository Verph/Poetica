## Recommendations
 - [x] It's quintessential to get OptiFine. [Get it from here](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=preview_OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_G6_pre1.jar). You install it like any other mod for Forge - no weird shenanigans!

 - [x] Add the following paragraph to the JVM parameters in either the CurseForge client or the Minecraft client launcher. Doing the latter forces you to paste in the JVM parameters every time you launch the game (it doesn't save them).

> -XX:NewSize=1G -XX:MaxNewSize=2G -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -d64 -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+AggressiveOpts

 - [x] Use the absolute latest version of Java 8 with Minecraft! The bundled version of Java 8 that comes with Minecraft is build 51, which is absolute trash. Currently the  *latest*  is  Version 8 Update 311. Get the one working on your system  [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). To use a custom version of Java 8 and custom JVM parameters in the CurseForge client, go to the settings here page this way:  *Settings --> Minecraft*

 - [x] Consider enabling the  *TFC Florae Lite resource pack*, that comes bundled with the modpack. It'll likely improve your game performance, by decreasing the overall RAM usage.

 - [x] Install OptiFine as per recommendation above.
